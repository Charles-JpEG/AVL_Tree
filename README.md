# AVL Tree Library

A high-performance, header-only AVL Tree implementation for C++. AVL trees are self-balancing binary search trees that maintain logarithmic time complexity for insertions, deletions, and searches.

## About AVL Trees

AVL trees (Adelson-Velsky and Landis trees) are binary search trees where the heights of the two child subtrees of any node differ by at most one. This self-balancing property ensures optimal performance for all operations.
